**[How this works]**
1. This directory contains child directories with exercises to complete.  Start with the 01 folder and move on to 02 and so on as you complete each folder. There can be more than 1 activity in each folder.
2. The goal of these exercises is not to see how many you can correct. The goal is to see how you work through them. 
3. Ask questions (it's how we work and there's no penalty for doing so)
4. Use Google
5. Use command help (e.g. grep --help)
6. You will be using a normal user account called with the name sandbox who has sudo ability, though you shouldn't need to sudo.
7. ssh into the Linux host with the IP and private key you were provided. Using the sandbox account.(e.g. ssh -i ~/theKeyHere sandbox@ipHere)
8. Once logged in wait until screen sharing is setup with all participants before moving forward.
